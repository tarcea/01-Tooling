## Student instructions

Welcome to the **React + Redux** track! Time for you to download the exercises:

1. First **fork** this repository (to your personal GitHub account)
2. Open the terminal, and clone the repo.
3. Then add the `upstream` remote to update the exercises when needed.

Step 2 and 3 above can be done with:

```bash
cd ~/code/<github_nickname>
git clone git@github.com:<github_nickname>/react-redux-challenges.git
cd react-redux-challenges
git remote add upstream git@github.com:lewagon/react-redux-challenges.git
```

Be sure to replace `<github_nickname>` with yours ü§ì

## Update the exercises

If the teacher tells you that you don't have the latest exercise on your computer, run the following:

```bash
cd ~/code/<github_nickname>/react-redux-challenges
git status # Make sure it's clean! Commit stuff if necessary
git pull upstream master
```

You should now be good to go, move on to the setup üëå

## Setup

The goal of this exercise is to make sure that your computer is ready!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Try to look at these instructions with a critic eye**. The goal is not for you to skim over the content and blindly copy/paste the terminal commands. **Read them** first, and ask yourself, what is it going to do? You may already have 95% of the tools installed on your computer, so no need to re-install them. For every install command, we give you the check command afterwards. Maybe you can run it first to see if the tool is already there? Just a hint ü§ì

Let's start!

### Oh-my-zsh

You should already have [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), a delightful framework for your `zsh` shell. This tool is configured thanks to the `~/.zshrc` file. Go ahead and have a look at it:

```bash
cat ~/.zshrc
```

You can also open this file in Sublime Text to inspect it.

### Node

Node.js is the Framework to run JavaScript outside your browser (server-side, or in your terminal). To install it, run the following commands:

#### OSX

You should already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

```bash
brew install node
# or: brew upgrade node
```

Check that node is installed with the following commands:

```bash
node -v # should output something bigger than 8.0
type -a node # should be '/usr/local/bin/node'
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Then check that `node -v` yields a version bigger than `8.0`.

### Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is the new dependency management tool you can use with NPM packages. It's a replacement over the `npm` command line which comes by default with Node.js.

#### OSX

To install `yarn` on your terminal, knowing you already have Node.js installed, run this:

```bash
brew install yarn
```

Check everything went smoothly with:

```bash
yarn -v # should be greater than 1.0
type -a yarn # should be '/usr/local/bin/yarn'
```

#### Ubuntu

To install `yarn` on Linux, you first need to configure the repository where to download it:

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

# Then install yarn:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
```

Then type `yarn -v` to check it's installed. Version should be greater than `1.0`.

### $PATH

Do you remember what is `$PATH`? [Read this](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables#File-location_related_variables). Basically, it's a list of folders where your operating system look when you type a command. When you type `ls`, the OS will look in the `$PATH` and see that `/bin` is in there. And `/bin/ls` exists! So it will run `/bin/ls`. That means that `ls` is just a **shortcut** for typing the whole path `/bin/ls`. Handy, isnt' it?

Run the following command:

```bash
echo $PATH | tr : \\n
```

You should have something like this:

```bash
./bin
./node_modules/.bin
/Users/<nickname>/.rbenv/shims
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
```

The two first lines are interesting.

1. `./bin` is useful when you work on a Ruby project using Bundler. [Binstubs](http://bundler.io/v1.10/bundle_binstubs.html) are files that live in the local `bin` folder of your project and can be executed from the command line. We used to prefix all our commands (`rails`, `rake`, etc.) with `bundle exec`. Thanks to binstubs, we can create a little file we can call with `./bin/rails` or `./bin/rake`. Having `./bin` in the `$PATH` means that we can simply type `rails` or `rake` to run this file. Very transparent!
2. `./node_modules/.bin` is something you might not have. Open your `~/.zshrc` file with Sublime Text and update the `export PATH` line. [This is what you should have](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/blob/master/zshrc#L22). Having `./node_modules/.bin` in the `$PATH` means that we'll be able to run executables from the NPM packages we download on a project. That will be useful for ESLint and Webpack. Instead of running `./node_modules/.bin/eslint` we can just type `eslint`! Again, very transparent :)

Once you've updated your `~/.zshrc`, save it, close all your terminals and restart. Run the following again:

```bash
echo $PATH | tr : \\n
```

All good?

### Sublime Text

If you don't have it already, please install the `Babel` package to use the ES6 syntax in Sublime. Don't remember [how to install a package](https://www.google.com/search?q=sublime+how+to+install+a+package)?

## Conclusion

You are now ready to work with a modern JavaScript environment, using ES6 syntax. Bear in mind the following analogies:

| Tool               | Ruby          | JavaScript     |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| REPL               | `irb`         | `node`         |
| Package Repository | Rubygems.org  | npmjs.com      |
| Package Manager    | `bundle`      | `yarn`         |
| Project File       | `Gemfile`     | `package.json` |
| Linter             | Rubocop       | Eslint         |
| Test Framework     | Rspec         | Jest           |

Let's code!
